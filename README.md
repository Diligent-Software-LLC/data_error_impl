# DataErrorImpl

Implements and subclasses the `DataError` interface. Defines the acceptable data 
argument types. Contains six methods. Three are `public` instance methods, one 
is a `private` instance method, and two are helper methods.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'data_error_impl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install data_error_impl

## Usage

### Constants

- `ACCEPTABLE_CORE_TYPES`

An array containing acceptable object types. The acceptable types are 
Complex, Float, Integer, Rational, String, Bignum, Fixnum, NilClass, Symbol, 
and Time.

- `INTERFACE`

Stores the superclass name.

### Public methods

#### `initialize(message_argument = nil)`

The constructor. In the case the argument is `nil`, sets the message attribute 
the `DEFAULT_MESSAGE`.

#### `message()`

Getter method. Gets and returns the message attribute.

#### `raise_exception(data_type)`

In the case the argument is an unacceptable type or a data structure, raises.
Takes a presumed acceptably typed object.

### Private methods

#### `message=(explanation)`

Setter method. In the case `explanation` is `nil`, sets the message attribute the 
`DEFAULT_MESSAGE`. Otherwise, sets the message attribute the explanation.

### Helper methods

#### `choose(explanation)`

In the case the argument is `nil`, returns the `DEFAULT_MESSAGE`. Otherwise, 
returns the argument.

#### `raise?(presumed_acceptable)`

In the case the argument is an unacceptable data type or a data structure, returns 
`false`. Otherwise, returns `true`.
